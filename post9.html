      <h3>The Re-Design of CD-ROM Drive</h3>
      <h4>Cornerstone Design Project</h4>

      <p>
        This project was started in my freshman year at college where I was
        tasked to design a gear-train that will use a new motor to drive the
        read-head while producing the same industry-standard read-head movement
        and speed.
        <br />
        <br />
        The original mechanism is assumed to be unavailable; the new motor will
        be in a completely different location with limited design space.
        <br />
        <br />
        The design must include a compound gear train occupying area of stage A,
        a worm-rack drive occuping stage B, and a custom-designed mounting
        bracket to hold all the components together.
        <br />
        <br />
        All the gears and custom components were modelled in Autodesk Inventor.
        The mechanism must be constrained to the model of the CD-ROM drive and
        scaled at 1:1 ratio.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sytem was modelled using MapleSim to demonstrate that the input and
        output speeds match the requirements. A test block that simulates the
        oscillating operation of the read head must be able to be properly
        connected to the simulated model.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, the customized components were 3D printed and then assembled to
        demonstrate their functionality.
